## ðŸŽ¨ Branding System

### HERE AND NOW AI Brand Integration

This website is powered by HERE AND NOW AI's dynamic branding system through `data/branding.json`. The branding system includes:

- **Logo & Favicon**: Automatically loaded from HERE AND NOW AI's CDN
- **Brand Colors**: Primary (#FFDF00) and Secondary (#004040) colors applied site-wide
- **Organization Details**: Contact information, website, and social media links
- **Slogan**: "designed with passion for innovation" appears in hero and footer

### How Branding Works

The `data/branding.json` file drives all brand elements:

```json
{
    "brand": {
        "organizationName": "HERE AND NOW AI",
        "website": "https://hereandnowai.com",
        "email": "info@hereandnowai.com",
        "mobile": "+91 996 296 1000",
        "slogan": "designed with passion for innovation",
        "colors": {"primary": "#FFDF00", "secondary": "#004040"},
        "logo": {
            "title": "logo-url",
            "favicon": "favicon-url"
        },
        "socialMedia": {
            "blog": "...", "linkedin": "...", "instagram": "...",
            "github": "...", "x": "...", "youtube": "..."
        }
    }
}
```

### Instant Branding Updates

- **Color changes**: Modify primary/secondary colors for instant theme updates
- **Content changes**: Update slogan, contact info, or social links
- **Contact changes**: Email and phone numbers update across all pages
